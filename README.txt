Testing GitHub (I actually don't know what I am doing, lmao)

The code is in PORTUGUESE!!
The program redeems points using pyautogui and also searches in bing to get points from it

OBS: The program needs a tcl file. You can find it at:
https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme/tree/main

This is my very first project. I learned everything I know while trying to make this.

Things I need to develop:

1. Wait for the user to log in if they aren't logged in.
2. Use Esc to activate failsafe (not working correctly).
3. Make that the directory of the folders can be anywhere (currently needs to be in "Documents").

Bugs:
-> ESC not working sometimes
-> If something in the actual site gets different it won't work, like some pop up or any redirect before the actual screen
