Testing GitHub (I actually don't know what I am doing, lmao)

The program redeems points in Microsoft Rewards using pyautogui. Be careful, it uses coordinates (it is set for monitors 1280x1024 at 100%).

This is my very first project. I learned everything I know while trying to make this.

Things I need to develop:

1. Wait for the user to log in if they aren't logged in.
2. Use Esc to activate failsafe (not working correctly).
3. Change the directory of the folders (currently needs to be in "Documents").
4. Make the program lighter.
