Testing GitHub (I actually don't know what I am doing, lmao)

The program redeems points in Microsoft Rewards using pyautogui. Be careful, it uses coordinates (it is set for monitors 1280x1024 at 100%).

OBS: The program needs a tcl file (You can find it at 
https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme/tree/main

The program is in portuguese. Good luck with it xD
This is my very first project. I learned everything I know while trying to make this.

Things I need to develop:

1. Wait for the user to log in if they aren't logged in.
2. Use Esc to activate failsafe (not working correctly).
3. Make that the directory of the folders can be anywhere (currently needs to be in "Documents").

Bugs:
-> ESC not working sometimes
-> If your monitor is different from 1280x1024 (5:4) it won't work
